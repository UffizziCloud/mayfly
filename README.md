## What is Uffizzi?

Uffizzi is a cloud-native REST API for managing lightweight, event-driven test environments on Kubernetes. It provides Development teams with an environments-as-a-service capability, while eliminating the need for Operations teams to configure and manage test infrastructure and tooling. 

## Use cases
Uffizzi is designed to integrate with any CI/CD platform as a step in your pipeline. Example use cases include rapidly creating PR environments, preview environments, release environments, demo environments, and staging environments. 

## Why Uffizzi?

- **üë©‚Äçüíª Developer-friendly** - The Uffizzi API provides a simplified interface to Kubernetes, allowing you to define your application with Docker Compose.

- **ü™∂ Lightweight** - Uffizzi test environments are isolated namespaces within a single cluster. This level of abstraction helps reduce a team's infrastructure footprint and associated overhead.

- **üîÅ Event-driven** - Designed to integrate with any CI/CD system, Uffizzi environments are created, updated, or deleted via triggering events, such as pull requests or new release tags. Uffizzi generates a secure HTTPS URL for each environment, which is continually refreshed in response to new events.

- **üßº Clean** - The ephemeral nature of Uffizzi test environments means your team can test new features or release candidates in clean, parallel environments before merging or promoting to production.

## Project roadmap

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with Uffizzi is via the managed API service provided by Uffizzi Cloud, as describe in the [quickstart guide](docs/quickstart-guide.md). This option is free for small teams and is recommended for those who are new to Uffizzi. Alternatively, you can get started creating on-demand test environments on your own cluster by following the [self-hosted installation guide](INSTALL.md).
