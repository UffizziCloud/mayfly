# Uffizzi App  

**The primary REST API for creating and managing Previews**

While it provides a documented REST API for anyone to use, it's most valuable when used with the open-source [`uffizzi_cli`](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_cli).  

## Uffizzi Overview

Uffizzi is an open-source engine for creating lightweight, ephemeral test environments for APIs and full-stack applications. Uffizzi enables teams to preview new features before merging and to mitigate the risk of introducing regressions into a codebase. Each preview gets a shareable URL that's updated when you push new commits or image tags, so teams can provide continual feedback during the development/QA process. Previews can be configured to expire or be destroyed when a pull request is closed, so environments exist only as long as they are needed. Uffizzi also helps deconflict shared development environments since previews are deployed as isolated namespacesâ€”there is no risk of clobbering another developer's preview. 

While Uffizzi depends on Kubernetes, it does not require end-users to interface with Kubernetes directly. Instead, Uffizzi leverages Docker Compose as its configuration file format, so developers do not need to modify Kubernetes manifests or even know about Kubernetes.

Uffizzi is designed to integrate with any CI/CD system.

## Uffizzi Architecture  
<img src="docs/images/uffizzi-architecture.png" description="Uffizzi Architecture" width="320"/>  

Uffizzi consists of the following components:  

* Uffizzi App (this repository) - The primary REST API for creating and managing Previews  
* [Uffizzi Controller](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_controller) - A smart proxy service that handles requests from Uffizzi App to the Kubernetes API  
* [Uffizzi CLI](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_cli) - A command-line interface for Uffizzi App  

Uffizzi requires the following external dependencies:  

 * Kubernetes (k8s) cluster  
 * PostgresSQL database  
 * Redis cache  

## Controller Design  

This `uffizzi_app` acts as a REST API for [`uffizzi_cli`](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_app) interface. It requires [`uffizzi_controller`](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_controller) as a supporting service.

## Uffizzi App Environment Variables

- `RAILS_SECRET_KEY_BASE` - secret_key_base of Rails::Application
- `DATABASE_HOST` - the database hostname (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `DATABASE_USER` - the database username (default: postgres)
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD` - the database password
- `DATABASE_PORT` - the database port (default: 5432)
- `BUNDLE_PATH` - the location of gems for `bundle install` command (not required)
- `GEM_PATH` - the location where gems can be found (not required)
- `GEM_HOME` - where gems will be installed (not required)
- `RAILS_WORKERS_COUNT` - the number of `puma` workers (default: 18)
- `RAILS_THREADS_COUNT` - the number of `puma` threads (default: 5)
- `RAILS_PORT` - the `puma` port (default: 7000)
- `RAILS_ENV` - the rails environment (default: development)
- `SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY` - sidekiq concurrency (default: 5)
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - allowed hosts for rails app used for Rack::Cors (default: [])
- `APP_URL` - URL of the application
- `REDIS_URL` - URL of a Redis server
- `CONTROLLER_URL` - URL of the controller application (default: http://controller:8080)
- `CONTROLLER_LOGIN` - the login of the controller application (default: '')
- `CONTROLLER_PASSWORD` - the password of the controller application (default: '')

## Prepare

```bash
docker-compose run --rm web bash -c "bundle install && bundle exec rails db:setup"
docker-compose up
```

## Connect from uffizzi-cli to the app

```bash
docker-compose run --rm gem bash
bundle exec uffizzi login --hostname http://web:7000 -u admin@uffizzi.com
```

password - `password`

## API Documentation

* [Development](http://lvh.me:7000/api-docs/index.html)

Rebuild documentation locally:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm core bash
bundle exec rake core:generate_docs
```

## Git workflow for the app:

1. Clone the repository and checkout to `develop` branch

2. Pull repository to ensure you have the latest changes
   
```bash
git pull --rebase develop
```

1. Start new branch from `develop`
   
```bash
git checkout -b feature/short_issue_description (e.g. feature/add_domain_settings)
```

1. Make changes you need for the feature, commit them to the repo
   
```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'short commit description' (e.g. git commit -m 'added domain settings')
git push origin BRANCH_NAME
```

1. You already can create PR with develop branch as a target. Once the feature is ready let us know in the channel - we will review

2. Merge your feature to `qa` branch and push. Ensure your pipeline is successful
   
```bash
git checkout qa
git pull --rebase qa
git merge --no-ff BRANCH_NAME
git push origin qa
```

# Running linter

```bash
docker-compose run --rm web bundle exec rubocop -A
```

# Running test

```bash
docker-compose run --rm core bash
bin/rails test
```

# Health checks

The default health check uri is `health_check`. To use a custom uri please add the `HEALTH_CHECK_URI` environment
variable to the docker-compose.yml
